# Vagrant 1.7.2

Different scripts to do different things.  

sys1/2 - standalone Puppet server and client nodes.  
combined - both nodes, defined in one Vagrantfile.  
ELK - building on combined, sets up an ELK server and a logstash forwarder node. Access Kibana on localhost:8080 on your host when it's provisioned.
